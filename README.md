# genshin-sorter
sorter for genshin chars or smth

this will be updated more later... just a small personal side project... more sorters here https://github.com/execfera/charasort/wiki

Edit: I didn't edit this for a while and don't have any immediate plans to as i am flooded with school. Future changes will be:

-Fixing gorou's sprite (forgot to give him one)

-fixing the embed background (???)

-moving ayato out of unreleased characters

-adding yelan and shinobu to unreleased characters (or just add them in directly if they come out before i update this and add in whoever else got drip marketed)

-add yaoyao to unreleased characters (idk)

.

If anyone knows how to fix the squished character portraits or has any further comments please let me know at CrimeaðŸ“ˆ#8100 on discord. thanx
