Can you see this? I hope you can see this. Look, I'm just a student, doing this in their small room at night instead of homework. I don't know how this whole "copyright" stuff works, and frankly i just want to do a fun small little project to share with some friends. I don't know anything about code, I just hope i didn't break some law or rule or something. Just let me know at my tag at Crimea#8100 if i need to fix something or whatever. Well, hope you have a good day/night/whatever if you do happen to be reading this :)

Uhhhh, well all characters are owned by Genshin Impact and Hoyoverse. I ripped the portrait images from the characters off the genshin impact wiki. They're pretty cool. I got the source code from the FumoFumo sorter. There's more sorters like it too, they're pretty cool.
Anything else I put here?
